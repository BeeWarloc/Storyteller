<!--Title: Embedding Images-->

Images can be hosted from the `/content` folder in your documentation project.

To write just the url of an image when you want full control of the html, use <code>&lt;[url:content/images/spec-explorer.png]&gt;</code>.

To write the image tag with a header capture, use the syntax:

<code>&lt;[img:content/images/editing/status-bar-success.png;Status Bar with a Success]&gt;</code>

The syntax inside the brackets is [relative path to the image file];[caption title].
