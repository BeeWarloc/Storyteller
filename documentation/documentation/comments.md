<!--Title:Embedding Comments in Specifications-->
<!--Url:comments-->

From the very beginning, Storyteller has allowed users to embed purely textual comments into the specifications. If you take the approach of using Storyteller to create system specifications as living documentation rather than just using Storyteller as an integration testing tool, comments are an invaluable tool to provide better explanations of the desired system behavior.

The specification below uses several comments to identify test cases.

Right now, comments are only pure text. If there is sufficient demand, Storyteller may add support for markdown in comments and possibly the ability to embed snippets of code or server supplied information in comments.
